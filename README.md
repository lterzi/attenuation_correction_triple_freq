# attenuation_correction_triple_freq

This set of python codes are used to correct for attenuation due to atmospheric gases at three radar frequencies. After gas attenuation has been calculated, the reflectivities of the three radars are matched in cloud regions where Rayleigh scattering can be assumed.
